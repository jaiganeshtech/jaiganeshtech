## Professional Summary

I am a **Cybersecurity Developer** with a strong focus on **security-first engineering**.  
I design and build **secure systems, defensive security tools, and automation** that address real-world threats and operational security challenges.

My approach combines **engineering discipline, threat modeling, and practical security controls** to deliver solutions that are reliable, maintainable, and production-ready.

Security is not an add-on — it is a **design principle**.
